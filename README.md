## Running Locally with Docker

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-test.html>

- Build the container:

  ```bash
  docker build -t my_function:latest .
  ```

- Run the default handler for the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -e WORKSPACE=dev -p 9000:8080 my_function:latest
  ```

- Post to the container:

  ```bash
  curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
  ```

- Observe output:

  ```
  "You have successfully called this lambda!"
  ```

## Running a Specific Handler Locally with Docker

If this repo contains multiple lambda functions, you can call any handler you copy into the container (see Dockerfile) by name as part of the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -p 9000:8080 my_function:latest lambdas.<a-different-module>.lambda_handler
```
